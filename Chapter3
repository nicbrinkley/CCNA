Chap 3: 
Leased Circuit: The words line and circuit are often used as synonyms in telco terminology. Circuit makes reference to the electrical circuit between the two endpoints.
Serial Link/Serial Line: The words link and line are also often used as synonyms. Serial in this case refers to the fact that the bits flow serially and that routers use serial interfaces. 
Point to Point: This terms refers to the fact that the topology stretches between two points, and two points only. (Some older leased lines allowed more than two devices.)
T1: This specific type of leased line transmits data at 1.544 megabits per second. 
WAN Link: Both of these terms are very general, with no references to specific technologies. 
Private Line: This term refers to the fact that the data sent over the line cannot be copied by other telco customers, so the data is private. 

two most common data-link protocols for leased lines between two routers are called HDLC (High level data link control) and PPP (Point to point protocol)

HDLC Header Fields to Ethernet: (HDLC Field, Ethernet Equivalent, Description)
Flag, Preamble SFD, Lists a recognizable bit pattern so that the receiving nodes realize that a new frame is arriving. 
Address, Destination Address, Identifies the destination device
Control, N/A, Mostly used for purposes no longer in use today for links between routers
Type, Type, Identifies the type of Layer 3 packet encapsulated inside the frame
FCS, FCS, Identifies a field used by the error detection process.

PoP: Point of presence
EoMPLS WAN Link can use ethernet connections both layer 1 and layer 2, meaning they can use the same packet frame. (You would not have to decapsulate/encapsulate the header and trailer because they can read ethernet headers.
