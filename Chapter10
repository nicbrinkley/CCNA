PVST+ = STP Based Per VLAN Spanning tree Plus= Creates one spanning tree instance per VLAN

RPVST+ = Rapid PVST+ = RSTP, one tree per vlan

MSTP = Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol

Name	Based on STP or RSTP?	#Trees	Original IEEE standard	Config Parameter
STP	STP	1 CST	802.1D	N/A
PVST+	STP	1/VLAN	802.1D	pvst
RSTP	RSTP	1 CST	802.1w	N/A
Rapid PVST+	RSTP	1/VLAN	802.1w	rapid-pvst
MSTP	RSTP	1 or more	802.1s	mst

System ID Extension = 4 bits Priority + 12 bits System ID Extension (Holds VLAN ID) + 6 bytes System ID (mac Address)

You can choose priority on a CLI by typing # spanning-tree vlan 1 priority ?

To configures switches to a root switch, type: spanning-tree vlan x root primary (on the primary switch) orâ€¦.
spanning-tree vlan x root secondary (on the secondary switch)

Switch Priority: The global command spanning-tree vlan x priority y lets an engineer set the switches priority on the vlan

Port Costs: spanning-tree vlan x cost y lets an engineer set the switches STP/RSTP cost on that port, either for all vlans or for a specific vlan on that port. 

Etherchannel: Two switches can treat multiple parellel links between each other as a single logical link called an EtherChannel. 

HOW TO CONFIGURE ETHERCHANNEL:

	1. Add the channel-group number mode on command in interface conf t under each physical interface that should be in the channel to add it to the channel.
	2. Use the same number for all commands on the same switch, but the channel-group number on the neighboring switch can differ. 

PAgP = Port Aggregation Protocol = Up to 8 links supported = desirable and auto keywords
LACP = Link Aggregation Control Protocol = up to 16 links supported = active and passive keywords

Switches check settings on neighbor switches by using PAgP or LACP OR use CDP = Cisco Discovery Protocol
