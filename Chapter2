Ethernet LAN: It is a combination of user devices, LAN switches, and different kinds of cabling. Each link can use different types of cables, at different speeds. 
utp = Unshielded twisted pair cabling
encoding scheme: The speaker and listener share the same language, and can act based off it.(Using binary, the speaker and listener can encode using 0s and 1s.)
EMI = Electromagnetic interference
The RJ-45 connector has 8 locations for the wires to go, otherwise known as pins. 

GBIC ( Gigabit Ethernet Interface Converter ): The original form factor for a removable transciever for Gigabit interfaces; larger tan SFPs
SFP ( Small Form Pluggable ): The replacement of GBICs, used on Gigabit interfaces, with a smaller size, taking less space on the side of the networking card or switch. 
SFP+ ( Small Form Pluggable Plus ): Same size as the SFP, but used on 10-Gbps interfaces. The plus refers to the increased speed compared to SFPs.

Ethernet NIC : transmitters use pairs connected to pins 1 and 2: The NIC recievers use the pair of wires connected at pins 3 and 6.
Lan Switches do the opposite, their receivers work at pins 1 and two: and their transmitters work at pins 3 and 6

Ethernet straight through cable connects wires at pin 1 to 1, pin 2 to 2, pin 3 to 3, and so on.
Crossover Cable: Pins:, 2 to 6, 3 to 1, and 6 to 2.

Crossover cable: If the endpoints transmit on the same pin pair
Straight through cable: If the endpoints transmit on different pin pairs

Switch to PC = Straight through cables
Switch to switch = Cross over cables

Multimode Fiber cabling: Improves the max distance over UTP, less expansive
Single mode fiber cabling: LARGE distances, more expansive

10GBASE-S - MM - 400m
10GBASE-LX4 - MM - 300m
10GBASE-LR - SM - 10km
10GBASE-E - SM - 30km

Ethernet Header and Trailer Fields:
Preamble, 7 bytes, used for synchronization
Start Frame Delimiter (SFD), 1 bytes, signifies that the next byte begins the Destination MAC Address field
Destination MAC Address, 6 Bytes, Identifies the intended recipient of this frame
Source MAC Address, 6 bytes, identifies the sender of the frame
Type, 2 bytes, Defines the type of protocol listed inside the frame
Data and Pad, 46-1500 bytes, Holds data from a higher layer and then adds padding to the data to meet length requirement of 46 bytes
Frame check sequence (FCS), 4 bytes, Provides a method for the receiving NIC to determine whether the frame experienced transmission errors. 

Burned in address: the 6-byte address assigned by the vendor making the card
Unicast address: A term for a MAC address that represents a single LAN interface.
Broadcast address: An address tat means "all devices that reside on this LAN right now".
Multicast address: On Ethernet, a multicast address implies some subset of all devices currently on the Ethernet LAN. 

FCS: Frame check sequence, in the ethernet trailer, compares results with the sender, to discover whether errors occurred in the frame. 
Half Duplex: The device must wait to send if it i currently receiving a frame; in other words, it cannot send and receive at the same time. 
Full Duplex: The device does not have to wait before sending; it can send and receive at the same time

hubs = half duplex, switches = full duplex

Half duplex uses CSMA/CD which is Carrier sense multiple access Collision Detection. Sends an alert to all nodes after a collision and stops sending. Gives a random time to wait before trying again.
