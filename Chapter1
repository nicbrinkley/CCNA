Chap 1:
SNA = System Network Architecture. Published by IBM, back in the 70s.
OSI Model = Open Systems Interconnection
RFC = Request for comments
IEEE = institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers

TCP/IP Model: Application, Transport, Network, Data Link, anad Physical Layers. 
Application: HTTP, POP3, SMTP
Transport: TCP,UDP
Internet: IP/ICMP
Data Link & Physical: Ethernet, 802.11 (Wifi)

HTTP = Hypertext Transfer Protocol
URI = Universal Resource Identifiers

1. Sends header with GET File. 
2. Response with a return code (200 OK for ex)
3. Data packet with file/request

TCP Error Recovery basics looks at SEQ (sequence) #s of the requests, and if one is missing or corrupt, it will send a TCP segmant back to the sender saying (Send again)

Adjacent-layer interaction: On a single computer, one lower layer provides a service to the layer just above. The software or hardware that implements the higher layer requests that the next lower layer performs the needed function.
Same-layer interaction: The two computers use a protocol to communicate with the same layer on another computer. The protocol defines a header that communicates what each computer wants to do. 

Using ethernet to forward an ip packet to a router.
1. Encapsulates the IP packet between an ethernet header and ethernet trailer, creating an ethernet frame.
2. Larry physically transmits the bits of this ethernet frame using electricity flowing over the ethernet cabling. 
3. Router R1 physically receives the electrical signal over a cable and re-creates the same bits by interpreting the meaning of the electrical signals. 
4. router R1 de-capsulates the IP packet from the Ethernet frame by removing and discarding the ethernet header and trailer. 

Data Encapsulation Terminology: 
TCP/IP Host sending data:
1. Create and encapsulate the application data with any required application layer headers.
2. Encapsulate the data supplied by the application layer inside a transport layer header.
3. Encapsulate the data supplied by the transport layer inside a network layer (IP) header. 
4. Encapsulate the data supplied by the network layer inside a data-link layer.
5. Transmit the bits.

1. [Data]					Application Layer
2. [TCP][Data]				Transport Layer 
3. [IP][TCP][Data]			Network Layer 
4. [Data link][IP][TCP][Data]	Data Link Layer
5. Transmit the bits			Physical Layer

Segment = [TCP][Data]
Packet = [IP][Data]
Frame = [LH][Data][LT]   (Layer Header/Trailer)
